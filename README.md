# Advent of Julia
 
My solutions to Advent of Code 2022. I thought it would be fun to try out [Julia](https://julialang.org/) this year as [Finn](https://github.com/inbelic) always sings its virtues. To spice it up even more I decided to try out [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) as my text editor for the event instead of vscode which I usually use (like everyone else).

Last year I focused on learning Rust and solving each day in a efficient and nice looking way, but this year I thought it would be fun to try going fast. So each day I try to wake up early and solve the puzzle when it is released. Most days have at least two versions, a messy one which is the one I used for submissions, and a cleaned up one which hopefully looks a bit better and works for both parts of the problem.
